# CISC475-Project
OCR Statistical Comparative Analysis

# Requirements
The primary goal is to test and compare the effectiveness of various Optical Character Recognition software.

# Design
For each image, test should compare two text files: the key (desired output), and the subject (output of each OCR). Each comparison is scored based on most matches and fewest deletions/mismatches between the character strings.
(Add something about writing code that allows user to run any OCR they want?)
