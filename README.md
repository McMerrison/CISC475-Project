# CISC475-Project
OCR Statistical Comparative Analysis

# Requirements
The primary goal is the test and compare the effectiveness of various Optical Character Recognition software. For each image, test should compare two text files: the key (desired output), and the subject (output of each OCR). Each comparison is scored based on most matches, fewest deletions and mismatches between the character strings.
(Add something about writing code that allows user to run any OCR they want?)
